first install openssl on windows and add "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\" to path
then run this single-line command and follow instruction:


openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 3650 -out domain.crt



rename domain.key and domain.crt with whatever you want
note: .crt and .cer extension are equivalent (no difference between but
you can convert between encodings by double-click->details->copy to file)
